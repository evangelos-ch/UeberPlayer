This fork adds support for system-wide now playing using [nowplaying-cli](https://github.com/kirtan-shah/nowplaying-cli). I also incoprorate the [fix by peppy from this issue](https://github.com/noatpad/UeberPlayer/issues/18) although with a higher refresh for my purposes, feel free to tweak this in `index.jsx`.

I also use Prettier for code formatting so that's why things look a bit off compared to the original code, and I also modify the defaults for the small player size and its typography. This fork is just for my dotfiles really, so sorry for not keeping things super consistent with the original codebase.

# UeberPlayer

An [Ãœbersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) widget that displays the currently playing song in a rather nice way. Forked from [Pe8er's Playbox](https://github.com/Pe8er/Playbox.widget), but rewritten with a bunch of new features and customization. I ended up liking this a lot to build it up again~

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Features

-   Supports iTunes (pre-Catalina), Apple Music, and Spotify
-   Comes in 4 different sizes
-   Displays artwork (all done locally when possible for both platforms)
-   Temporarily caches artwork for offline use and quicker loading
-   Adaptive colors! (thanks to [Color Thief](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/))
-   Hides itself when nothing is playing
-   Completely rewritten in JSX and streamlined Applescript
-   Quite customizable

## Installation

You can download the `UeberPlayer.widget.zip` file from the repo, clone the repo and download it from there, or grab the zip from the [latest release](https://github.com/acluelessdanny/ueberplayer/releases/latest).

Drop the folder in your widgets folder, refresh, and profit.

## Settings

Open `index.jsx` and there'll be an `options` object for customization. Mess around with those settings to your heart's content. Here's what it generally looks like and what you can change with them:

```js
const options = {
    /* Widget size! */
    size: "big", // -> big (default) | medium | small | mini

    /* Widget position! */
    verticalPosition: "top", // -> top (default) | center | bottom | "<number>" | "-<number>"
    horizontalPosition: "left", // -> left (default) | center | right | "<number>" | "-<number>"

    /* Widget visibility! */
    alwaysShow: 0, // -> 0 (default) | 1 | 2

    /* Adaptive colors! */
    adaptiveColors: true, // -> true (default) | false
    minContrast: 2.6, // -> 2.6 (default) | number

    /* Visual customization! */
    dualProgressBar: false, // -> true | false (default)
    miniArtwork: false, // -> true | false (default)

    /* Cache setting! */
    cacheMaxDays: 15, // -> 15 (default) | <number>

    /* Check for updates */
    checkForUpdates: true, // -> true (default) | false
};
```

### Size

Select from one of the 4 available sizes by setting `size`:

-   `big` (default): Big and bold player!
-   `medium`: Slightly smaller version of the big player, with more concise information.
-   `small`: Horizontal-like player. Smaller but pretty colorful.
-   `mini`: Much more minimalistic setup with a big progress bar

### Positioning

`verticalPosition` and `horizontalPosition` allow you to position the player in different areas of the screen.

They also allow number values (enclosed as a string) for pixel measurements from a screen's border. Using negative numbers (including -0) will position the player from the opposite side.

-   `verticalPosition`: `top` (default), `center`, `bottom`, `"<number>"`, `"-<number>"`
-   `horizontalPosition`: `left` (default), `center`, `right`, `"<number>"`, `"-<number>"`
    -   If you're using the mini player, this setting will also affect its text alignment

> Note: When using number values, make sure they're enclosed in quotes, like `"5"`, `"-10"`, etc.

### Visibility

By default, the widget will only show when a track is being played; otherwise, it will hide itself. This behavior can be altered with the `alwaysShow` option. The following values will change its behavior:

-   `0` (default): The player will only show when a track is being played.
-   `1`: The player will only show when a music player is open, regardless if a track is playing or paused (for example, when Spotify is open, but playback is paused).
-   `2`: The player will always be displayed, regardless of anything.

> Note: When `alwaysShow` is set to `1` or `2`, a small caveat present is that the widget won't update until the track begins playing again. This is usually not a problem, but cases like the widget startup or restarting the music app will yield outdated information in the widget until a track plays again.

### Adaptive colors

You can have adaptive colors based on the current track's artwork! This can be activated by setting `adaptiveColors` to `true`. If you're worried about performance, there's no need to worry because it performs this process only when the track changes (though you're free to disable it for whatever reason).

You can also set the minimum contrast with `minContrast`. The text and background must be for a color to be used when extracting them. This _won't_ modify the colors selected, but rather the selection of colors (in other words, different values can yield different color combos). The default value should be good on its own, but you can tweak it to your needs. The higher the value, the more contrast it'll attempt to achieve (a good place to test and read up about it is with the [Contrast Ratio site](https://contrast-ratio.com/)).

-   `adaptiveColors`: `true` (default), `false`
-   `minContrast`: `2.6` (default), `<number>`
    -   This can be any number, but 0-21 are the only values with actual effect, where 0 means equal colors and 21 is black and white. I made my tests and settled on **2.6**, but W3 recommends up to **4.5**. It's up to you~

> Note: You might need to refresh your widget after changing this setting.

### Progress bar

You can choose to have a dual-colored progress bar. The second color is applied on the "empty" area.

-   `dualProgressBar`: `true`, `false` (default)

> Note: The mini player will always have its "empty" area, but this setting will add some color to it.

### Mini artwork

When `size` is set to `mini`, you can optionally show or hide the artwork, using the `miniArtwork` setting. The text box and alignment wil adjust accordingly.

-   `miniArtwork`: `true`, `false` (default)

### Caching

This widget caches artwork images for quicker loading & offline usage. To help manage space, every time you load or refresh this widget, it checks the cache for any "old" artwork (from albums you haven't played in a while) and deletes them.

This setting sets how many days old the artwork must be for it to be deleted from the cache. For example, setting `5` means any album that hasn't been played for 5 days will be deleted. Setting it to `0` means it'll delete the cache completely every time it loads.

-   `cacheMaxDays`: `15` (default), `<number>`

### Update checking

This widget can also periodically check for any available updates. When `checkForUpdates` is `true`, it will check for updates on startup and then subsequently every 24 hours. If an update is available, a small link will appear.

Clicking this link will run a script to automatically download and update the widget, while carrying over your settings to the new version (beta). You may need to restart Ubersicht upon completion.

![update](images/update.png)

-   `checkForUpdates`: `true` (default), `false`

> **NOTE**: The link in the text is only clickable if you've enabled the `Enable interaction` option within Ubersicht. It can still serve as an update notification if you desire to leave the option off though.

## Developing

When you clone the repo, you can develop using a variety of `gulp` scripts. Use `gulp apply` to quickly copy the developing widget into your widgets folder, & `gulp dev` to watch for changes and apply them into the widgets folder.
